# Check Collision

## Questions
1. Add function that determines when id="bee1" or id="head1" collide. When they collide each element should then move in the opposite direction.
2. Add function that determines when id="bee1" or id="head2" collide with body's border. When they collide each element should then move in the opposite direction.
3. Randomize 'bee1Speed' and 'head1Speed'
    - ***BONUS*** Randomize 'bee1Speed' on collision
    - ***BONUS*** Randomize 'head1Speed' on collision
4. Add the ability for id="bee1"" to move in all directions, ie, move the 'top', while still adhering to collisions
    - ***BONUS*** Top speed should be different than 'bee1Speed' and randomized on collision
    - ***BONUS*** Do the same for id="head1"
5. Add new id="bee2"" div with class = "bee". This "bee2"" should move at its own speed, top and left, and check for collisions with id="head1" only
