# Fix defects

## Questions
### Fix these defects
1. Only the clicked list item (li) should highlighted in yellow when an individual list item (li) is clicked.
2. Only the clicked list item should be de-highlighted (white) when an invididual list item is highlighted.
3. When button is clicked, it should add a new list item to the corresponding unordered list (ul) with the number of list items plus 1, for example, if you add list item to id="ul1-list" the new list item should be "Item 4"

### Features to add
1. Show count of list items next to span. This should update when new list items are displayed.
2. When a list item is clicked, it should also underline list items from other lists with the same name, for example, when "Item 1" is clicked in list 1, "Item 1" in list 1 should be highlighted and "Item 1" in list 2 should be underlined
3. When a highlighted item is clicked, any other list item with the same name should remove its underline.
